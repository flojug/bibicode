about: |
    This application allows the conversion of any natural number from one representation (a numeral system) to another. A numeral system is represented by its digits which can be any combination of UTF-8 chars. For example, "0", "1" will represent binary system.

after_help: |+
    The following numeral systems are pre-integrated into the application and can be used :
      - dec for decimal
      - hex for hexadecimal
      - bin for binay
      - base58 for base 58 used in bitcoin address representation
      - bibi for bibi-binary as defined by Boby Lapointe, the inspirator of this application
      - budu for an experimental numeral system which is well readable
      - utf8 for an experimental numeral system which is a combination of serveral utf8 symbols

    Numeral systems can also be described by a json file

    Example 1 : representation of binary in a file
    {
        "prefix":"0b",
        "digits":["0","1"]
    }

    Example 2 : bibi-binary system
    {
        "digits":[["H", "B", "K", "D"],["O", "A", "E", "I"]]
    }

    Example 3 : base58
    {
        "digits": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z", "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"]
    }
